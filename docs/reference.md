# API Reference

Generated from docstrings and the `scistudio.stability` decorators by
mkdocstrings + griffe (ADR-052 §7), version-stamped to this package's release.
This is the **developer-facing reuse surface** (ADR-052 §4.2, §13.1): the types,
their constructors, and the public helpers an author imports. Block and
previewer classes are the registration surface, not author API, so they are not
in this reference.

<!-- TODO(#1817): render the ADR-052 §5 tier / Since as a per-symbol badge via a
     griffe extension that reads __scistudio_stability__, and host multiple
     versions side by side (mike), once the core generated-reference toolchain
     lands. Out of scope for the minimal parity build per ADR-052 §7.
